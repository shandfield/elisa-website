    //I want to add in card bodies that when clicked will direct the user to the kannaway, people or pets pages. I want those in the center, lined up horizontal 
    //I also want to make the background picture kannaway farms in the Netherlands, and make a schema that matches it
    //In the header/nav bar I want a drop down box that the user can also use to go to the different pages, as well as the shopping cart function from the square page https://happyhavasu.square.site/#sIFryK
    //Also in the header- I want Elisa's Company Logo Centered 
    //In the footer, I want Company name est 2018 Copyright 2020 
    //Also need to add in the Contact Information- Only on landing page? Or add to each page via the footer? 
    //On the sides- Show Reviews on the left and on the right maybe like Upcoming Items/Sales 
    // How do I create a alert asking if someone wants to join the newsletter and store the emails? -- How does Elisa want that handled- Like does she want to send out an email to them?
    //Elisa also wants a page where people can connect, leave messages and where she can post things (this can be an extra thing for now)
