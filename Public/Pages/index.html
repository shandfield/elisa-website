    <p class="card-text">My name is Elisa, I am a proud Breast Cancer Survivor since 2011. My passion to help others through Kannaway CDB and Young Living Essential Oils began in 2018. Even though I overcame my battle with Cancer, my mother and sister did not. When one of my Golden Retrievers wa diagnosed with cancer and I wanted to help him, as I knew all to well what happened with Chemo. This is where my journey began and Happy Havasu was born. I wanted to help him, and began my research. Coupled with my love and passion for animals and humans alike, I dedicated myself to learn what I could do to bring peace and comfort. I have personally used every DIY that I created with essential oils on all five of my fur babies, and they have been successful. I also have used my personal blends on my friends pets and all have had successful outcomes. I believe in the Young Living brand as I have been to their farms and know how the oils are made. I can attest that they do not source from outside farms, use chemicals and that they are safe for both humans and animals. <br>

    I love coming home to my healthy babies, 
    When I am sad, all I have to do is be with them and they make everything good again. They are always happy to see me and I can't do anything but love them. I talk to them and they seem to know just what to do. I am making fewer trips to the vet, specially when it comes to ear infections, skin irritations and or cuts and wounds. I am by no means an expert on curing animals and always like to caution people that if you see something that doesn't go away in a couple of days or week, then they must take their baby to a vet where they can diagnose properly.
    I am dedicated to finding a way to move from chemicals and drugs to Essential Oils and CBD for our pets and humans when able. Our ancestors used plants to cure so many things, so why can't we!</p>
