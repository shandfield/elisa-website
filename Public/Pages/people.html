                ðŸŒŸFAVORITE PRODUCT: I use this spray in my mouth to prevent getting a cold, the flue or any other sickness. You first feel a numbness in the throat because of the Clove and then it goes away in about a 40sec or so. I also use this when I travel and will use this spray in a hotel room, when I use a public restroom and anywhere there are a lot of people.</p>
