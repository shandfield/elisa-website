## Motivation
I wanted to help out a family friend that had a pretty basic website for her business and make more polished and user intuitive one. She is a small buisness owner, and sells products for people and animals to help heal with CBD. She also sells essential oils and other pet products. I really wanted to help her grow her business as well, espcially with COVID 19 happening. 

## Technologies
HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap for now, more to come as the build continues.
